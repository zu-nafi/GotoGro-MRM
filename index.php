                Goto Grocery is a grocery shop based in Hawthorn that provides high-quality groceries to its customers. They use a paper-based method to record customer information and sales data. Recently, they found it challenging to manage the expectations of their customers and meet their food demands. They often ordered products that customers did not need.
				They need software to assist them in managing customer data and promptly informing them of customers' shopping requirements.

            </p>

            <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
            <p id="homebodyp">
                The Members Record Management (MRM) software will replace the current paper-based system for record-keeping. The software will feature GUI (Graphical User Interface) that will be user-friendly and will display member, sales and item records.
				The software will solve many persistent problems associated with the previous data storage system (Book-based system). The programme must feature cloud storage and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). It should also display record history and be categorised in a variety of ways.
